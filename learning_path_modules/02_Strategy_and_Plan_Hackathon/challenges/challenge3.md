# Module 02 - Strategy and Plan Hackathon

## ## Challenge 3

This challenge's focus is on preparing and presenting a high-level financial assessment using Azure Migrate.  You will be using this pre-populated Excel file which contains information about Contoso’s current digital estate.

Your team will need to create an Azure Migrate assessment to gain an understanding of what the estimated costs would look like post-migration. 

Spend some time reviewing the contents of the file and the results of the Azure Migrate assessment. The final assessment will contribute to the team’s business case.

**Learning objectives:**

- Take inventory of your digital estate
- Understanding cloud costs
