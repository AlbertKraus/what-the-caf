# Module 02 - Strategy and Plan Hackathon

## Challenge 2

To create a balance between speed and control, we recommend that during cloud adoption, at a minimum, you have people accountable for cloud adoption and cloud governance. In this challenge you will have the opportunity to review the organization structure and establish a plan for initial organizational alignment to support the adoption plan. You are also required to understand business risk which is one of the most important elements of any cloud transformation. Risk drives policy, and it influences monitoring and enforcement requirements. Risk heavily influences how we manage the digital estate, on-premises or in the cloud.

**Learning objectives:**

- Manage organization alignment
- Understand the importance of business risk

## Key Points to be covered

- Identify which potential roles would play a part in the cloud adoption and cloud governance teams (leverage the [Cross-team RACI](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/microsoft/CloudAdoptionFramework/master/organize/raci-template.xlsx) “MVP” tab as a reference guide).
- Define your own business risk MVP which will support initial small scale cloud deployments, and which can then be used as a base for gradually identifying and remediating new risks as business needs arise or additional workloads are added to the customer's cloud environment.

## Challenge 2 – Success Criteria

1. Build a cloud adoption and cloud governance teams MVP based on an initial best practice structure (referencing the RACI chart).
2. Build a business risk MVP which includes at least 6 risks (but not more than 10). Remember that the MVP will be presented to non-technical audiences, so choose your words wisely.
