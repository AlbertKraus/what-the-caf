# What The CAF

# Azure Landing Zone Partner Practice Accelerator

In this 2-dayÂ [hackathon](https://github.com/jonathan-vella/what-the-caf/blob/main/learning_path_modules/04_ALZ_Accelerator), attendees will learn how the Azure landing zone accelerator enables their partner organization to make templatized landing zone deployments with baked-in repeatable best practices for governance, security, and compliance.

It comes with a set of design principles for managing the platform at scale; these principles serve as a compass for subsequent design decisions across critical technical domains.

At the end of this hackathon, attendees will be able to leverage the existing reference implementations, be able to build their own, assess and document landing zones, as well as understand how to establish policy-driven governance.

## Target Audience

This workshop is applicable to any technical role with a responsibility or involvement in Azure projects:

- IT Professional
- Database Engineer
- Application Developer or DevOps Engineer
- Cloud Solution Architect
