# What The CAF

# Strategy and Plan Hackathon

This hackathon enables attendees to understand and get
familiar on how the Microsoft Cloud Adoption Framework for Azure (CAF) can be
applied with their customers. This hackathon walks through the Define Strategy
and Plan phases of the CAF to support attendees in leading a client engagement
that is considering moving their digital assets to Azure.

It simulates a real-world scenario where a
company has multiple datacenters with hundreds of line-of-business
applications. The company is looking at migrating and modernizing their current
digital estate to Microsoft’s cloud platform. Since the company has a global
presence, they need support in optimizing their current solutions and processes
so that their multiple business groups can focus on their core business.

During the hackathon, attendees will focus on learning how
to leverage the CAF in guiding a customer through starting on a successful
cloud adoption journey. Attendees will have the opportunity to gain hands-on
experience by creating a business case, building a cloud adoption plan, and
leveraging multiple cloud assessment tools to support a customer with
justifying their cloud adoption.

By the end of the hackathon, attendees will have built
a cloud adoption plan that they can use to present to a customer’s C-Suite to
justify adopting the cloud. The purpose of this exercise is to provide you with
the tools and understanding that will complement the conversations attendees
may be having with their customers.
